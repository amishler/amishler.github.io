      <description>About I am a third year PhD student in the Department of Statistics &amp;amp; Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I work with Professor Edward Kennedy on causal inference problems related to algorithmic fairness and bias. I also worked with Professor Rebecca Nugent on clustering methods to estimate latent class parameters in cognitive diagnosis models.
I previously worked as a Data Scientist/Quantitative Analyst Intern at Google in New York City, applying statistical machine learning to text classification.</description>

      <description>Parameter estimation in cognitive diagnosis models using clustering Cognitive Diagnosis Models (CDMs) are a type of latent class model used frequently in education and psychometrics. One typical application is to estimate whether students in a learning environment have mastered or not mastered each of a set of K skills. Traditional likelihood-based estimation methods are computationally intensive and become intractable for large datasets. I am investigating how to optimally estimate skill profiles using a lightweight, model-agnostic alternative: clustering, via k-means type algorithms or hierarchical agglomerative clustering.</description>
